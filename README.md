MatchUp is a client-side image comparison library.
MatchUp has no dependencies because it works on the client side with the HTML5 Canvas2D API of the browser. 
The main function of MatchUp is to compare two images. After comparison, MatchUp generates a numerical value between 0 and 1 that indicates the error rate. With an additional MatchUp feature, it is also possible to highlight the incorrect pixels in the image that help you instantly see where errors occur.
By comparing each pixel with its adjacent pixels with an adjustable tolerance, MatchUp assesses whether there is a discrepancy or not.
